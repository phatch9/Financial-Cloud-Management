| User Management | Secure registration, login, and user profiles | Spring Security (OAuth2/JWT) for authentication and authorization |
| Transaction CRUD | Ability to create, read, update, and delete financial transactions (e.g., groceries, salary).	| Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) for persistence and REST controllers |
| Budgeting	Users | Set spending limits per category | Business logic layer to calculate remaining budget dynamically|
| Reporting & Dashboards | Visualizations of spending trends, category breakdowns, and monthly summaries | REST endpoints provide structured data to the frontend for charting (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js)|
| Receipt Upload | Option to upload a photo of a receipt for a transaction.	| AWS S3 integration via the Spring Cloud AWS SDK|

## Technology Stack & AWS Integration
Demonstrating how SpringBoot Framework fully integrates with AWS services:

Frontend:
Modern Java framework like React or Angular (as suggested in search results) to consume the Spring Boot REST APIs.

Structure: Single-page application (SPA).

Communication: Axios/Fetch to consume the JSON REST APIs exposed by the Spring Boot server.

Styling: Tailwind CSS or custom CSS for a modern, responsive design.
Backend (Java / Spring Boot)
- Framework: Spring Boot 3 (using Java 17+).
- Data Access: Spring Data JPA with a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
- Security: Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.
- Deployment Packaging: Dockerfile to containerize the Spring Boot JAR for modern deployment.

AWS Infrastructure

## Configuration
Backend Config:
- Generates a Maven project with the core dependencies and unzips it directly into the backend-api folder
```
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
-d dependencies=web,data-jpa,postgresql,security \
-d type=maven-project \
-d name=server \
-d artifactId=server \
-d groupId=com.cloudmanagement \
-d javaVersion=17 \
-d packageName=com.cloudmanagement.server \
| tar -xzvf - -C server --strip-components 1
```
For more information, direct to https://start.spring.io/ and manually generate Parameters and add dependencies:
- Spring Web (for REST endpoints)
- Spring Data JPA (for database access)
- PostgreSQL Driver (or MySQL Driver)
- Spring Security (for authentication)

Unzip the file and move its contents into empty backend or server directory.

- Start Backend (Ensure Database: PostgreSQL, etc is running)
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
---
POSTGRE Notes:
- Always check the role of user and grant permission for user:
- Connect to the PostgreSQL with identified SuperUser
```
psql -U /user/ postgres
```
- List all roles to identify the superUser at the prompt postgre=>
```
\du
```
